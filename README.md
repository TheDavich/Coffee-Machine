## â˜• Features

### Brewing Coffee

- The program allows you to brew three types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
- To brew a coffee, you'll need to enter the number corresponding to the coffee type when prompted.
- The coffee machine checks if it has enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans, and cups) to make the selected coffee.
- If there are enough resources, it brews the coffee, deducts the resources, and adds money. Otherwise, it displays a "Not enough resources" message.

### Refilling Resources

- You can refill the coffee machine's resources by choosing the "fill" option.
- You'll be prompted to enter the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups you want to add to the machine.

### Taking Money

- The program allows you to take the money earned from coffee sales. Choose the "take" option to do this.

### Displaying Remaining Resources

- The "remaining" option displays the current state of the coffee machine, including the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money.

### Exiting the Program

- Choose the "exit" option to exit the program.
