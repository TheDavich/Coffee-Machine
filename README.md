Coffee Machine ‚òï
Welcome to the virtual coffee machine! This is a console application that allows you to make your favorite coffee, refill ingredients, take money, and check the remaining resources.

‚òï Features
Brewing Coffee: You can select the type of coffee you want to brew (espresso, latte, cappuccino), and the application will check if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans, and cups) to make the chosen beverage. If everything is in order, your coffee will be brewed, and the cost will be added to the total money.

Refilling Ingredients: If you run out of any ingredients (water, milk, coffee beans, cups), you can refill them into the coffee machine.

Taking Money: You can withdraw the money collected by the coffee machine.

Checking Remaining Resources: You can check the current status of the coffee machine, including the remaining:

Water (in ml)
Milk (in ml)
Coffee beans (in grams)
Disposable cups
Money (in dollars)
Exit: You can exit the coffee machine application.
